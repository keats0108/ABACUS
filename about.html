            <p>The aim of ABACUS is to promote and celebrate Eastern and Western cultural exchange. We host a number of diverse events throughout the year that centre on socialising, meeting new people and having fun. The society prides itself on being incredibly inclusive and welcoming to new faces, whether you may be a BBC (British Born Chinese), an international student or someone who would like to partake in our range of fun events, you are more than welcome to join us!
            <br><br>
            Our flagship event is the annual ABACUS Boat Party hosted in London (in collaboration with the Oxford University Asia-Pacific Society) during the end of Michaelmas<sup>1</sup>. Our members are invited to join us in a night of luxury and grandeur as we sail down the Thames against the backdrop of the glistening London skyline. There will be a myriad of food, drink and entertainment options during the evening so make sure you don’t miss out!
            <br><br>
            In addition to our annual boat party, we host several other events ranging from club nights to non-drinking events such as Funkyard (the biggest Asian club night in Cambridge), and the Garden Party, as well as a number of smaller events, such as dim sum meetups, karaoke nights and formals. We promise that there is something for everyone! The society is also extremely proactive with regards to increasing the cohesion of the Asian community within Cambridge and we host several inter-society events that encourage the appreciation of a diverse range of cultures and, of course, allow our members to meet a wider range of people across the university.            
            <br><br>
            One of the best things about Cambridge ABACUS is the strong sense of community between our members and the lasting friendships that are formed as a result. The society acts as a home away from home for many of our members and allows you to establish a sense of belonging in the new environment that you are faced with when coming to university. We set up ‘ABACUS families’ early in the year and host a number of family formals so that new members are easily integrated into the community and have ‘parents’, who are more settled at the university, to be there to offer you guidance and support, whilst also providing a source of familiar faces at our events. We not only care about your welfare in our society, but also your future beyond university too, providing information when we can about exciting career opportunities that may be of interest.
            <br><br>
            We strongly encourage you to come along to our events, whether this may be with friends or by yourself, to become a part of our flourishing community here in Cambridge and, most importantly, to have a good time!
